Files submitted: 
model.txt, result.txt, readme.txt, ham_spam.py(code),
Report.pdf containing our results, and train and test folders with data.

Running the code: 

1. In the code at line 8, 10, 12 and 14 we gave the number of ham and spam training and testing files 
   in the folders so as to read them with libraries mentioned in the project requirement.If the program 
   is tested with a different dataset please change these values accordingly so the program runs smoothly.
 
2. The code needs numpy, re and math libraries.   

3. The train and test dataset folders must be in the same directory as the code file and the 
   text file names should be similar to the given dataset.

4. When the code is run, it outputs the confusion matrices and evaluation metrics for both 
   ham and spam classes on the console. 

5. It also produces model and result  files as well in the same directory as the code.

6. Appropriate comments were given in the code for explaination.
